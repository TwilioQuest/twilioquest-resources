## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will:

| Objective 1 | Objective 2 | Objective 3 |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Learn about different types of data that can be represented in code.  | Use variables to store data. | Use `process.argv` to take data into their programs from the user. |

## Essential questions

- What is the difference between 2 and "2" in Javascript?
- How do you declare a variable in Javascript?
- How should you declare a variable whose value you don't want to change?
- How do we access arguments passed to our program at execution?

## Activities in this lesson

During this lesson, students will complete 4 mission objectives. You can find more detail about each objective later in the lesson plan.

- [Set up your Node.js environment](#objective-1-variable-results)
- [Create a workspace](#objective-2-multi-variable)
- [You didn't say please](#objective-3-script-arguments)
- [Begin the big test](#objective-4-begin-the-big-test)

## Before the lesson begins

When students return to TwilioQuest between lessons, they will find themselves aboard the Fog Owl again. Their progress in the missions will have been saved. To pick up where they left off, they just need to go to the virtual reality pod with the green light on the right side of the Fog Owl, and select the Javascript Test Lab mission again.

When re-entering the mission, they will be at the start of the level, but will not have to recomplete any previously completed objectives. Direct students to walk through the level to the last opened barrier to start the lesson.

## Objective 1: Object of my affection

## Objective 2: Class Act

## Objective 3: Enable beam 4

## Objective 4: Reverse the experiment
