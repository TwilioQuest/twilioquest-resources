## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will:

| Objective 1 | Objective 2 | Objective 3 |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Install Node.js in order to be able to execute Node.js programs during future mission objectives.| Create a workspace in the terminal to store Node.js files throughout the Mission. | Write and execute their first Node.js programs. |

## Essential questions

- What is the difference between Node.js and Javascript?
- Where is Node.js installed on a computer?
- What version of Node.js are you currently using?
- What is the terminal?
- How do you change directory in a terminal?
- How do you create a file for a Javascript program?
- How do you run a program written in Javascript with Node.js?

## Activities in this lesson

During this lesson, students will complete 3 mission objectives. You can find more detail about each objective later in the lesson plan. 

- [Set up your Node.js environment](#set-up-your-nodejs-environment)
- [Create a workspace](#you-didnt-say-please)
- [You didn't say please](#set-up-your-nodejs-environment)

## Before the lesson begins

It's recommended that TwilioQuest be installed before the start of the lesson. TwilioQuest is available for MacOS, Windows and Linux [here](https://www.twilio.com/quest/download). See the [IT guide]() for more information on installing TwilioQuest on both personal, and school lab machines.

On first starting TwilioQuest, students will be prompted to create an avatar (a character). If students are using their own machines and installing before the class, you could encourage them to share their avatars ahead of the lesson to create anticipation for the upcoming class.

### Teams and operations

## Boarding the Fog Owl

When student's start TwilioQuest, they will find themselves in a ship, the Fog Owl. The Fog Owl is the hub of TwilioQuest: from here, students can access all of the Missions available in the game.

Students can learn more about TwilioQuest by speaking to Cedric. When they are ready, they can end the conversation and climb into the virtual reality pod to select the mission.

The virtual reality pods can be found in the right-most room of the Fog Owl. Students can open the mission select by standing on the green and black diagonal stripes, in front of the pod with the green light, and pressing <kbd>Space</kbd>.

From the mission select screen, select JavaScript Test Lab. 

## Beginning the Mission

When students enter the mission, they will be greeted again by Cedric. Cedric can tell them more about what to expect from the mission, both in terms of what they will learn about Javascript, and also what work is being done in the Test Lab. Once they are ready, the first objective is on the right of the screen. It can be accessed by walking up to the console next to the laser field and pressing <kbd>Space</kbd>.
