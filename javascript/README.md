# Teaching Javascript with TwilioQuest

These resources aim to give you everything you need to use the TwilioQuest mission `Javascript Test Lab` in your classroom. This repository contains:

- [Mission content overview](#mission-contents): what will students learn during the mission.
- [Lesson plans](#lesson-plans): example lesson plans for a series of 60-90 minute lessons built around the mission.
- [Instructors' slides](#instructors-slides): ready-to-go slide decks that you can use in the classroom whilst teaching the mission.
- [Sample solutions](#sample-solutions): code that satisfies the criteria to complete each objective.
- [Student handouts](#student-handouts): cheatsheets and guides to help students use TwilioQuest effectively.
- [Further resources](#further-resources): further information about external material referenced and linked in the course of the mission.
- [IT/Sys-admin guide](#IT-guide): Preparing your school or student machines for the mission.

# Mission contents

The `JavaScript Test Lab` teaches the fundamentals of programming with JavaScript. It uses the JavaScript back-end runtime, Node.js, and so does not teach any browser-specific JavaSript concepts. You can find more information on Node.js vs Browser JavaScript in this [comparison](https://nodejs.dev/learn/differences-between-nodejs-and-the-browser).

# Lesson plans

These example lesson plans are for a series of six 60-90 minute lessons covering Javascript fundamentals using the `Javascript Test Lab` as core teaching material. 

- [Lesson 1: Installation and setup](/javascript/lesson-plans/lesson-1.md)
- [Lesson 2: Variables and program input](/javascript/lesson-plans/lesson-2.md)
- [Lesson 3: Control flow and boolean logic](/javascript/lesson-plans/lesson-3.md)
- [Lesson 4: Functions and arrays](/javascript/lesson-plans/lesson-4.md)
- [Lesson 5: Loops and iteration](/javascript/lesson-plans/lesson-5.md)
- [Lesson 6: Objects and classes](/javascript/lesson-plans/lesson-6.md)

# Progress and class structure

TwilioQuest has two mechanisms to group and organize students and keep tabs on their progress:

- Adventure teams: group students in long-lasting teams and see the groups XP and completed objectives.
- Operations: events that students can participate in together as a contest for a given period of time. Any points that students score between the start and end of an operation are tracked on that operation's leaderboard.

Here are some ways you might want to use adventure teams or operations in your classroom:

- Simple progress tracking: create one adventure team for all students so that you can easily see each student's progress and completed objectives.
- Weekly assignments: group students in small adventure teams, and create weekly operations, acting both as a fun contest, and assignment due date.

You can create adventure teams and operations from the [Operator console](https://twilio.com/quest/app/educator). When creating an adventure team or operation, you will be given a join code. Students can join the team or operation by entering the join code in the settings of their TwilioQuest app.

# Sample solutions

Many of the objectives in TwilioQuest require the player to write code to progress. Here you can find sample solutions to pass each objective. It's important to note that in most programming languages, there are many ways to achieve an end result, and code may pass the objective that doesn't look exactly like the samples. Where more than one interesting solution exists for an objective, there may be more than one sample provided.

You can view all samples [here](/sample-solutions).
