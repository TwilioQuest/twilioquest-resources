# Introducing students to TwilioQuest

The TwilioQuest prologue introduces students to the world of TwilioQuest, and teaches them how to play the game: how to control their character, interact with other characters, and how to complete objectives.

This document provides a standalone lesson plan for the prologue mission. This lesson can be used as a introduction to TwilioQuest for any of the other lessons available in this repository.

Please note that whilst the mission is skippable, it is not possible to return to the mission once skipped without erasing progress.

## Mission contents
